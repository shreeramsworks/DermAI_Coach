# DermAI Coach

## Project Overview
DermAI Coach is a privacy-focused, AI-powered web application designed to help users track and manage chronic skin conditions. It utilizes Google's Gemini 3 Pro multimodal model to analyze user-submitted photos and text descriptions, providing non-medical visual observations and wellness advice.

## Core Capabilities
- **Visual Analysis**: detailed, non-clinical observation of skin texture, color, and patterns.
- **Symptom Logging**: summarizing user-reported sensations (itching, pain) and emotional state.
- **Evidence-Based Grounding**: uses Google Search to cross-reference wellness tips with high-authority medical sources.
- **Local Privacy**: processes images in-session without permanent server-side storage.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: @google/genai SDK (Gemini 3 Pro)
- **Deployment**: Static SPA (Single Page Application)
